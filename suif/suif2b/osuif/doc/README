These directory contains support for DOC++
(See http://www.imaginator.com/doc++)

osuif.dxx is the toplevel documentation node.


The generated docu is rather disappointing and annotating the code
seems to be too intrusive. For this reason we stopped using DOC++. (If
enough ppl yell at us we might reconsider...;-))
