Printing:
-  pretty-print driver outputs the osuif intermediate format in a readable 
   manner.
-  To the driver we can specify the commands in a file, an example file 
   testporky.osuif2 is in the current directory. 
-  To execute the pretty_print with this file the command is:
   pretty_print -f testporky.osuif2
-  This pass, performs a pretty print for the osuif intermediate formats. 
   To further extend or modify the output a user can register his own print 
   methods with the printing_maps.
